## Introduction
This repository demonstrates the implementation of a simple deposit and withdrawal system using blockchain technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. 
The goal is to provide a practical understanding of:
- Wallet creation and management.
- Transaction generation and broadcasting.
- Interacting with blockchain nodes and smart contracts.

## Folder Structure
- `docs/`: Documentation for concepts and system flow.
- `examples/`: Practical examples for Bitcoin and Ethereum-based deposit and withdrawal.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the examples.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the project.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
  - bitcoinlib
  - web3.py
  - eth-keys
  - other dependencies as required
